The 'templates' projects standardizes components, establishing a cohesive SRCT style across our projects, and assists developers creating new projects.

On Contributing
---

Templates is still in its very early stages and welcomes all the help it can get. Even if you don't feel like you can be help with the more technical aspects, we definitely need designers, technical writers, and testers.

There are many things that can be done with this project (see the "To Do" section), but sometimes it's the small things that count, so don't be afraid of contributing just a small spelling mistake.

If you need help at all please contact and SRCT member. We want people to contribute, so if you are struggling, or just want to learn we are more than willing to help.

The project lead for this project is **Daniel Bond**. *dbond2@gmu.edu*

Please visit the [SRCT Wiki](http://wiki.srct.gmu.edu/) for more information on this and other SRCT projects, along with other helpful links and tutorials.

To get started, you'll need to have the following installed:
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Open a terminal window and type in the following commands. (If you're on Windows, use [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/). This wil create a local, workable copy of the project.

``bash``
``git clone git@git.gmu.edu:srct/templates.git``
``cd templates/``


To-do

* Modifying [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and creating other css files to create a SRCT "theme" that can be used across multiple projects while remaining compliant with GMU design standards.
* Posting common files for frameworks, or other kinds of files that might be needlessly repeated across projects.
